# CAPSTONE PROJECT

This project works on the classification of birds species

The project works on two phases, one on SVM and one on CNN

## Dependencies

The notebooks showcased in this repo, were run on kaggle notebooks. These notebooks comewith preinstalled ML frameworks. But if you want to run it on locally.

Below is the codes that you need to run on your python3 virtual environment

### Install TensorFlow
```
pip install tensorflow==2.12.*
```

### Install Numpy
```
pip install numpy
```

That's it you can run all these notebooks in your local virtual environment

## Datasets

The datasets for this project were taken from the kaggle datasets. 

[This](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species) dataset is really a very large. This dataset consists of images of 510 species of birds. 

It consists of 81,950 train images, 2550 test images and 2550 validation images. Each image is composed of 224X224 pixels containing three layers of R, G and B.
